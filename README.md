# Three or More Dice Game

Players in turn roll all five dice and score for three-of-a-kind or better.  If a player only has two-of-a-kind, they may re-throw the remaining dice in an attempt to improve the matching dice values.  If no matching numbers are rolled, a player scores 0.

Players score the following number of points accordingly:

3-of-a-kind: 3 points
4-of-a-kind: 6 points
5-of-a-kind: 12 points

A set number of rounds are played (say 5) and the player with the highest total score at the end of a game, is the winner.
